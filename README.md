## Components

### MainEditor

The `MainEditor` component is responsible for rendering the main text editor interface. It utilizes the Tiptap library for rich text editing and Recoil for managing the application state. Users can format text, change font styles, undo/redo changes, and save notes.

### MainNav

The `MainNav` component represents the navigation bar of the application. It allows users to create new notes, edit existing notes, and cancel creating a new note. It also utilizes Recoil for managing application state.

### SideView

The `SideView` component displays a side panel containing a list of saved notes. Users can search for specific notes, view note titles, creation dates, and times. Additionally, users can delete notes from the list. This component also relies on Recoil for state management.

### ShowSavedNotes

The `ShowSavedNotes` component displays the content of a saved note. It allows users to view the content of a note and print it with custom filenames.
